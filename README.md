# Old Mac's Farm

Old Mac's Farm is a interactive web application that allows users to send real-time messages, but they can only use the letters "e," "i," and "o," inspired by the classic "Old MacDonald Had a Farm" song. Built with React and Socket.io, this project showcases real-time communication and creative message input limitations.
